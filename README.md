# WiFi-Controlled-Arduino-RC-Car
This is a project made to control an Arduino based RC car with a webpage built in the code.

To begin, the following parts are needed for this project:
- ESP8266 WiFi module
- Arduino Uno board (or whatever PCB you wish to use, but be warned that the code may need changes accordingly)
- a 2WD Arduino Robot chassis (one can be found here)
- breadboard
- assorted wires, female to male and male to male connectors are needed, as are three transistors.
